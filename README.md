# shell_scripting_reference
This repository contains basic flow of programming and syntax for a bash shell scripting reference

==================================================================================================================
When trying to run your first .sh file, you will most likely recieve an error: Permissions Denied Error.
-THis is because you have to give the file permission to be an executable, to do so:

''' chmod +x filename '''

trying to run a new shell script can throw a Permissions Denied Error.
>> To solve this problem use command: chmod +x filename //allows you to run the file

Running the file: ./filename.sh

when creating a shell script must use "shabang" /location/bash
>>to find the location of where bash is located use command: which bash. that location will be used following shabang
-----#shabang: #!

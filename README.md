# shell_scripting_reference
This repository contains basic flow of programming and syntax for a bash shell scripting reference

=======================================================================================
 
When trying to run your first .sh file, you will most likely recieve an error: Permissions Denied Error.
-This is because you have to give the file permission to be an executable, in terminal, run command:
```shell
chmod +x filename 
```
======================================================================================
Running the file:
```shell
./filename.sh
```
=======================================================================================
when creating a shell script must use "shebang" /location/bash
to find the location of where bash is located use command: which bash. that location will be used following shebang.
shebang (#!) may look like:
```shell
#! /bin/bash
```
